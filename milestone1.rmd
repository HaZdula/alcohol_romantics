## Zbiór

Context:
The data were obtained in a survey of students math and portuguese language courses in secondary school. It contains a lot of interesting social, gender and study information about students. You can use it for some EDA or try to predict students final grade.

Content:
Attributes for both student-mat.csv (Math course) and student-por.csv (Portuguese language course) datasets:

school - student's school (binary: 'GP' - Gabriel Pereira or 'MS' - Mousinho da Silveira)
sex - student's sex (binary: 'F' - female or 'M' - male)
age - student's age (numeric: from 15 to 22)
address - student's home address type (binary: 'U' - urban or 'R' - rural)
famsize - family size (binary: 'LE3' - less or equal to 3 or 'GT3' - greater than 3)
Pstatus - parent's cohabitation status (binary: 'T' - living together or 'A' - apart)
Medu - mother's education (numeric: 0 - none, 1 - primary education (4th grade), 2 – 5th to 9th grade, 3 – secondary education or 4 – higher education)
Fedu - father's education (numeric: 0 - none, 1 - primary education (4th grade), 2 – 5th to 9th grade, 3 – secondary education or 4 – higher education)
Mjob - mother's job (nominal: 'teacher', 'health' care related, civil 'services' (e.g. administrative or police), 'at_home' or 'other')
Fjob - father's job (nominal: 'teacher', 'health' care related, civil 'services' (e.g. administrative or police), 'at_home' or 'other')
reason - reason to choose this school (nominal: close to 'home', school 'reputation', 'course' preference or 'other')
guardian - student's guardian (nominal: 'mother', 'father' or 'other')
traveltime - home to school travel time (numeric: 1 - 1 hour)
studytime - weekly study time (numeric: 1 - 10 hours)
failures - number of past class failures (numeric: n if 1<=n<3, else 4)
schoolsup - extra educational support (binary: yes or no)
famsup - family educational support (binary: yes or no)
paid - extra paid classes within the course subject (Math or Portuguese) (binary: yes or no)
activities - extra-curricular activities (binary: yes or no)
nursery - attended nursery school (binary: yes or no)
higher - wants to take higher education (binary: yes or no)
internet - Internet access at home (binary: yes or no)
romantic - with a romantic relationship (binary: yes or no)
famrel - quality of family relationships (numeric: from 1 - very bad to 5 - excellent)
freetime - free time after school (numeric: from 1 - very low to 5 - very high)
goout - going out with friends (numeric: from 1 - very low to 5 - very high)
Dalc - workday alcohol consumption (numeric: from 1 - very low to 5 - very high)
Walc - weekend alcohol consumption (numeric: from 1 - very low to 5 - very high)
health - current health status (numeric: from 1 - very bad to 5 - very good)
absences - number of school absences (numeric: from 0 to 93)
These grades are related with the course subject, Math or Portuguese:

G1 - first period grade (numeric: from 0 to 20)
G2 - second period grade (numeric: from 0 to 20)
G3 - final grade (numeric: from 0 to 20, output target)
Additional note: there are several (382) students that belong to both datasets .
These students can be identified by searching for identical attributes
that characterize each student, as shown in the annexed R file.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}

summary(df)

slices <- which(colnames(df) %in% c("Medu", "Fedu", "famrel", "freetime", "freetime", "goout", "Dalc", "Walc", "health", ))

df[, slices] <- lapply(df[, slices], as.factor)
```

```{r}

```{r}

```

```{r}

colnames(df)
ggplot(df, aes(x = Dalc, y=Walc, color = romantic)) + geom_jitter()

ggplot(df, aes(x = G1, color = romantic)) + geom_density()
ggplot(df, aes(x = G2, color = romantic)) + geom_density()
ggplot(df, aes(x = G3, color = romantic)) + geom_density()

ggplot(df, aes(x = Dalc, fill = romantic)) + geom_bar(position='dodge')
ggplot(df, aes(x = Walc, fill = romantic)) + geom_bar(position='dodge')


ggplot(df, aes())
```
```{r}

ggplot(x, aes(x = Walc, y = Freq, fill = romantic)) + geom_bar(position = "dodge", stat = "identity")

tab <- table(df[,c("romantic", "Dalc")])
x <- as.data.frame(prop.table(tab, 1)*100)
ggplot(x, aes(x = Dalc, y = Freq, fill = romantic)) + geom_bar(position = "dodge", stat = "identity")
